      "b'\"\\n\\nIn response to Bduke\\'s question 2 above, I think that it has become very difficult on wikipedia to say anything general about Guiding and Girl Scouting because someone will always point out that some Guides are boys. This is a fair point, but I think it has become overdone. If you take a look at the WAGGGS website, it\\'s all about girls. Not girls and a few boys. They say of themselves \"\"The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is a worldwide Movement providing non-formal education where girls and young women develop leadership and life skills through self-development, challenge and adventure.\"\" Their catchphrase starts \"\"Girls worldwide say...\"\" WAGGGS has not felt it necessary to change its name. This is not because they don\\'t realise some WAGGGS member organisations take boys, it\\'s because taking boys is an anomaly, not the norm. It\\'s an anomaly we shouldn\\'t ignore, but nor should we get too wrapped up in it.   \"'\n",
